  title = 	{A Proof Theory for Description Logics},
  year = 	{2010},
  abstract =    {Description Logics (DLs) is a family of formalisms
                  used to represent knowledge of a domain. They are
                  equipped with a formal logic-based
                  semantics. Knowledge representation systems based on
                  description logics provide various inference
                  capabilities that deduce implicit knowledge from the
                  explicitly represented knowledge. In this thesis we
                  investigate the Proof Theory for DLs. We introduce
                  Sequent Calculi and Natural Deduction for some DLs
                  (ALC, ALCQ). Cut-elimination and Normalization are
                  proved for the calculi. It is argued that those
                  systems can improve the extraction of computational
                  content from DLs proofs for explanations purpose.},

  abstract = {Distributed and concurrent application invariably have coordination
requirements. The design of those applications, composed by several
(possibly distributed) components, has to consider coordination
requirements comprising inter-component interaction styles, and
intra-component concurrency and synchronization aspects. In our
approach coordination aspects are treated in the software architecture
level and can be specified in high-level contracts in CBabel ADL. A
rewriting logic semantics for the software architecture description
language CBabel is given, revisiting and extending previous work by
some of the authors, which now includes a revision of the previous
semantics and the addition of new features covering all the
language. The CBabel tool is also presented. The CBabel tool is a
prototype executable environment for CBabel, that implements the given
CBabel's rewriting logic semantics and allows the execution and
verification of CBabel descriptions in the Maude system, an
implementation of rewriting logic. In this way, software architectures
describing complex applications can be formally verified regarding
properties such as deadlock and synchronization consistency in the
software architecture design phase of its life cycle.}

specific characteristics of the concrete application domain and

user or service, depends on environment-specific constraints and
dynamic changes in the environment have to be considered in all stages
of development, the separation between the system's behaviour and its
context representation (a.k.a. context model) is essential for
facilitating the development of such inherently complex systems. At
the same time, because of its well-known benefits, a formal
specifications should be considered not only for describing the
system's behaviour, but also the corresponding context
model. Considering this, we propose in this paper an environment to
support context modelling through formal specification. For this sake,
we adopt the algebra of contextualized entities proposed and define
levels of abstractions over its diagrams, enabling a stepwise
construction of modular specifications. The overall goal is to reduce
the gap between the formal description of an ubiquitous application
and its implementation.}

  abstract = {Distributed and concurrent application invariably have coordination
requirements. The design of those applications, composed by several
(possibly distributed) components, has to consider coordination
requirements comprising inter-component interaction styles, and
intra-component concurrency and synchronization aspects. In our
approach coordination aspects are treated in the software architecture
level and can be specified in high-level contracts in CBabel ADL. A
rewriting logic semantics for the software architecture description
language CBabel is given, revisiting and extending previous work by
some of the authors, which now includes a revision of the previous
semantics and the addition of new features covering all the
language. The CBabel tool is also presented. The CBabel tool is a
prototype executable environment for CBabel, that implements the given
CBabel's rewriting logic semantics and allows the execution and
verification of CBabel descriptions in the Maude system, an
implementation of rewriting logic. In this way, software architectures
describing complex applications can be formally verified regarding
properties such as deadlock and synchronization consistency in the
software architecture design phase of its life cycle.}

knowledge of a domain. In con- trast with others knowledge
representation systems, Description Logics are equipped with a formal,
logic-based semantics. Knowledge representation systems based on
description logics provide various inference capabilities that deduce
implicit knowledge from the explicitly represented knowledge.  In "A
sequent calculus for alc" we present a sequent calculus for ALC , a
basic Description Logic, called SALC . The first motivation for
developing such system is the extraction of computational content of
ALC proofs. The present calculus is an intermediate step towards a
Natural Deduction System for ALC . In this paper we present the proof
of cut elimination for SALC .}

                  (ALC, ALCQ). Cut-elimination and Normalization are
                  proved for the calculi. It is argued that those
